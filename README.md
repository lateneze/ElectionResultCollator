# ElectionResultCollator

This project is implemented to collate results of elections from various polling stations. The motivation for the project is to address the issue of poor network connectivity in remote areas where polling agents will find it difficult to use internet to transmit polling result.

With this software, polling agents only have to send the results at the end of the polls using an SMS to a collator who automatically intercepts the results and automatically processes and updates the results on a dashboard of pie charts that displays the progress of the results until the polls close. 

There is therefore no need for manual calculations of poll results or the use of Excel to manually compute results.

One has to have a modem attached to the computer to receive the transmitted results from the various location.
